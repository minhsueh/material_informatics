Two concerns when applying data-driven methods to material science are:

1. Data Size:
Data-driven approaches rely heavily on the availability of sufficient data. One of the key challenges in many fields is the lack of adequate data, especially where data collection is costly or resource-intensive.

2. Data Bias:
Traditional research often follows an incremental process, where innovations build upon existing materials. This can create a bias toward specific elements, limiting the diversity of data. As a result, data-driven methods tend to interpolate within the known dataset. To expand the discovery of new materials, incorporating active learning and exploration techniques is crucial.
